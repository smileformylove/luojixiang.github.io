# About Me

# <img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Jixiang Luo (骆继祥)**.

Now I work at Xiaohongshu MediaLab for AICodec(end-to-end image and video compression), image or video processing after two years experience at Sensetime Research. I received bachelor's and a master's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I major in data compression, video compression and signal processing advised by Prof. Hongkai Xiong and Prof. Wenrui Dai at [MIN lab](min.sjtu.edu.cn). 

I believe **compression is to represent the world**. My current research focuses on the representation of multi-modal signals, inclding image, video, text and audio. While my major job now is for image or video processing and accelerate the progress of the deployment for AICodec.
